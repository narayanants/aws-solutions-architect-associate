EC2 101 Part 2:
===============

EBS:
====

	* Virtual disk attached to EC2.
	* EBS are placed in specific availability zones,where they are automatically replicated to protect you from failure.

EBS Volume Types:
=================

	General Purpose SSD (GP2)
		- Balance price and performance
		- 3 IOPS/GB upto 10,000 IOPS and burst upto 3000 IOPS

	Provisioned IOPS (SSD) (IO1)
		- I/O Intensive Apps
		- For NoSQL Databases.
		- Use if more the 10,000 IOPS
		- upto 20,000 IOPS

	Thoughtput optimized (ST1)
		- Big Data
		- Data Warehousing
		- Log Processing
		- Cannot be Boot Volumes

	Cold HDD (SC1)
		- Lowest cost storage for infrequently accessed workloads.
		- File Server
		- Cannot be a boot volume.

	Magentic (Standard)
		- Lowest cost per gig
		- Bootable
		- Data is accessed infrequently.

Exam Tips:
==========
	
	* GP2 - 10,000 IOPS
	* IO1 - 20,000 IOPS
	* ST1 - frequently accessed workloads
	* SC1 - less frequently accessed workloads
	* Magentic - bootable, infrequently accessed workloads.


	* You cannot mount one EBS volume to multiple Ec2 instances instead using EFS
