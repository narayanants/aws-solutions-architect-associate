Upgrading EBS Volumes:
=====================


	* GP2
	* IO1
	* ST1
	* SC1
	* Magnetic


	* Snapshots are point in time copies of Volumes.
	* Snapshots are incrementals. Blocks changed are only moved to S3.
	* Snapshots of encrypted volumes are also encrypted.
	* Volumes restored from encrypted Snapshots are also encrypted
	* You can share snapshots, but only when are unencrypted.
