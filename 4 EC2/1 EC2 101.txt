EC2 101:
========

	
	* Resizable Compute Capacity in cloud.
	* Scale up and down
	* Pay only for what you use
	

Ec2 Options:
============

On demand - Pay by the hour
Reserved - discount on hourly charge of an instance. Need to sign contracts.
Spot - Rate moves around.
Dedicated - Dedicated EC2 Server for your use.


On Demand:
==========

	Low cost and flexibility of Ec2 without any upfront payment

Reserved:
=========

	* Apps with steady state or predictable usage.
	* Apps that require reserved capacity
	* Make upfront payments to reduce total computing costs further.

	Standard RI (upto 75% DISCOUNT)
	Convertible RI(54% discount)
	Scheduled RI - Launch wihtin the time window.

Spot:
======

	Flexible start and end times.
	apps feasible only at low compute costs
	Urgent Computing Needs

Dedicated Hosts:
================

	Use for regulatory requirements
	Great for licensing.
