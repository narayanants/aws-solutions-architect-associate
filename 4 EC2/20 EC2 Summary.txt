Exam Tips - EC2:
=================

Pricing Models:
===============

    * On Demand
    * Spot
    * Reserved
    * Dedicated


    EBS Types:
    =========

    * General Purpose SSD (GP2) - 10,000 IOPS
    * Provisioned IOPS (IO1) - 20,000 IOPS
    * Throughput optimized(ST1) - frequently accessed workloads
    * Cold HDD (SC1) - less frequently accessed workloads
    * Magnetic - Standard,cheap,infrequently accessed workloads.

    * You cannot mount 1 EBS volumes to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS.

    Ec2 Lab Tips:
    ==============

    * Termination protection is turned off by default, you must turn it on.
    * On a EBS backed instance, the root EBS volume is terminated once the Ec2 instance is terminated.
    * EBS backed root volumes can now be encrypted using AWS API or console.
    * Additional volumes can also be encrypted.

    Volumes vs snapshots:
    =====================

    * Volumes exist on EBS - virtual hard disk
    * snapshots exists on S3.
    * You can take a snapshot of a volume, this will store the volume on S3.
    * snapshots are just point in time copies of volumes.
    * Snapshots are incremental. This means that only blocks that are changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3.

    Security:
    =========
    * snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically.
    * Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically.
    * You can share snapshots, but only when they are unencrypted.


    Snapshots of root device volumes:
    ==================================

    * To create a snapshot of root device volumes, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.
    
    EBS vs instance store:
    ======================

    * Instance store volumes are sometimes called as Epehermal Storage.
    * Instance store volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails,you will lose data.
    * EBS backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose data on the instance if it is stopped.
    * You can reboot both, you will not lose your data.
    * By default, both root volumes are deleted on termination.
    * However,with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.


    AMI Exam Tips:
    ==============

    * AMI are regional.
    * You can launch an AMI from the region in which it is stored.
    * However you can copy AMI to other regions through console, command line or the Amazon EC2 API.


    Monitoring:
    ===========

    Standard = 5 minutes
    Detailed = 1 minutes

    CloudWatch is for performance Monitoring
    CloudTrail is for auditing.


    What can i do with CloudWatch:
    =============================

    Dashboards
    Alarms
    Events
    Logs


    Roles:
    =======

    * Roles are more secure than storing you Access Key ID and secret Key on the individual EC2 instances.
    * Roles are easier to manage.
    * Roles can be assigned to an EC2 instance after it has been Provisioned using both the CLI and the AWS console.
    * Roles are universal.

    Instance Metadata:
    ==================

    Info about the instance

    curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data ( such as public IP)
    http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data

    EFS:
    ====

    NFS v4 protocol
    Pay only for the Storage
    can scale upto the petbyte
    can support thousands of concurrent connections
    Data is stored across multiple AZs within a region.
    Read after write consistency.


    Lambda:
    ========

    Compute service.

    Placement Group:
    ================

    Clustered Placement Group
    Spread Placement Group
