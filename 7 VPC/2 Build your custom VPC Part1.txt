Build your custom VPC Part1:
============================

    * When we create a custom VPC, it will create a 

        * SG
        * NACL
        * Route Table

    * 10.0.0.0, 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3, 10.0.0.255
    * Lose 5 IP addresses when you provision an Subnet.
    * When we create a Subnet, by default it is assocaiated to a single route table.
    * Security Groups don't span VPC.
