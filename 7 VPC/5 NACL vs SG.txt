NACL vs SG:
===========

* NACL is subnet level
* SG is instance level

* NACL is stateless
* SG is stateful

* In default Network ACL, all inbound and outbound traffic is allowed by default.
* Custom Network ACL, all inbound and outbound traffic is blocked.

* 1 Subnet can be associated with 1 AZ and 1 NACL.
* By default, all inbound and outbound traffic is denied by default for custom NACL.
* Order of the Rule matters in NACL.

Exam Tips:
==========

* VPC comes with default NACL and by default it allows all outbound and inbound rules.
* Custom NACL, denies inbound and outbound rules until you add rules.
* Each subnet must be associated with a NACL, else subnet is associated to the default NACL.
* Associate NACL with multiple subnets. but 1 subnet can be associated with 1 NACL at a time.
* When you associate a NACL with a subnet, previous assocation is removed.
* NACL contains numbered list of rules and are evaluated in order they are created, lowest number rule first.
* NACL have separate inbound and outbound rules.
* NACL are stateless.


Block IP Address using NACL's not SG.
