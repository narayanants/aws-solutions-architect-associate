VPC Summary:
============

    * When creating a NAT instance, disable source/destination check in NAT instance.
    * NAT instance must be in public subnet.
    * There must a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance, in order for it to work.
    * amount of traffic the NAT instance can handle depends on the instance size.
    * Highy available NAT instances using Autoscaling groups,multiple subnets in multiple AZ and a script to automate failover.
    * Behind a SG.

NAT Gateway:
============

    * Preferred by Enterprise
    * Scale automatically upto 10Gbps.
    * No need to patch.
    * Not associated with SG.
    * automatically assigned a public IP Address.
    * Remember to update Route table.
    * No need to disable source/destination checks.
    * More secure that NAT instance.


NACL:
====

    VPC comes with default NACL with both inbound and outbound 
    Custom NACL, blocks inbound and outbound rules.
    Each subnet must be associated with 1 NACL, else default to default NACL.
    Associate a NACL with multiple subnet, 
    Subnet can be associated with only 1 NACL.
    When you associate a NACL, previous association is removed.
    NACL have numbered list of rules and evaluated in order, starting with lowest order.
    NACL have separate inbound and outbound rules.
    They are stateless.
    Block IPs using NACL not SG

ALB:
====

    * 2 public subnet to deploy an ALB.

Flow Logs:
==========
