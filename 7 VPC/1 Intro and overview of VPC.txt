Intro and overview of VPC:
==========================

    * Virtual Private Cloud
    * Virtual Data Center in the Cloud
    * VPN between VPC and corporate Cloud
    * 10.0.0.0 

    Connect using:

        * Internet Gateway
        * Virtual Private Gateway

    What can you do with an VPC:
    =============================

        * Launch instances into a subnet of your choosing
        * Assign custom IP Ranges in each subnet.
        * Configure Route tables between the subnet.
        * Create an internet Gateway and attach it to VPC.
        * 1 internet Gateway per VPC.
        * Much better security controls across AWS resources.
        * Instance security group.
        * Subnet ACL

    Default VPC vs Custom VPC:
    =============================

        * Default VPC is user friendly,allowing you to immediately deploy instances.
        * All subnets in the default VPC have a route out to the internet.
        * Each EC2 instance will have both Public and private IP addresses.

    VPC Peering:
    =============

        * Allows you to connect one VPC to another via a direct network route using private IP address.
        * Instances behave as if they are in the same private network.
        * Peering in a star configuration. 

    Exam tips:
    ==========

    * Logical DC in AWS
    * Consists of IGWs or Virtual Private Gateway,Route Tables, NACL, Subnets,Security Groups.
    * 1 subnet = 1AZ
    * Security Groups are stateful. NACL are stateless.
    * No Transitive Peering
