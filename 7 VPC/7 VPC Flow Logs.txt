VPC Flow Logs:
===============

    * Capture IP traffic flowing to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
    * Flow log data is stored using AWS CloudWatch Logs.
    * After you have created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data using AWS CloudWatch logs.


Flow Logs can  be created in 3 levels:
======================================
    * VPC
    * Subnet
    * Network Interface Level.


Exam Tips:
=========

    * Cannot enable Flowlogs for your VPCs that are peered with your VPCs unless the peer VPC is in your account.
    * You cannot tag a flow log.
    * After you have created a flowlog, you cannot change its configuration.
    * Not all IP Traffic is monitored.
