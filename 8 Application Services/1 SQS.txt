SQS:
=====

    * Simple Queue Service
    * Oldest AWS Service
    * Gives access to a message Queue which can be used to Queue messages.
    * Queue is a temporary repository,
    * Queue acts as a buffer between the producer and the consumer.
    * Resolves issues if the producer is producing work faster than the consumer can process it.
    * Or if the producer or consumer are only intermittently connected to the network.


    Two types of Queue:
    =====================

    * Standard Queue (default)
    * FIFO Queue

    Standard Queue:
    ================

    * Unlimited transactions per second.
    * deliver messages atleast once.

    FIFO Queue:
    ===========

    * Received/Delivered in order
    * Once Processing.
    * Duplicates are not introduced in the Queue.
    
    SQS Key facts:
    ===============
    * Pull based system.
    * 256KB in size.
    * Messages are kept in the queue from 1 minute to 14 days.
    * Default retention period is 4 days.
    * SQS guarentees that your Messages are processed atleast once.


    Visibility Timeout:
    ==================
    * The Visibility Timeout is the amount of time that the message is invisible in the SQS Queueafter a reader picks up that message.
    * Default Visibility Timeout is 30 seconds.
    * Increase if your task takes > 30 seconds.
    Maximum is 12 hours.


    Exam Tips:
    ==========

    * distributed message queuing system.
    * decouple the components of an app so that they are independent.
    * Pull based
    * Standard Queue and FIFO Queue
    * FIFO Queue - order strictly preserved. No Duplicates.
    Visibility Timeout - default 30 seconds.
    Max hours - 12 hours

    Short polling - returned immediately even if there are no messages in the queue.
    Long polling - polls the queue periodically and returns a response when a message is in the queue or the timeout is reached.
