Backups, Multi-AZ and Read Replicas:
====================================

    * 2 types of Backups

        Automated
        Database snapshots

    Automated Backups:
    ==================

        * Enabled by default
        * Allow you to recover database to any point in time within a retention period.
        * Retention period can be between 0 to 35 days.
        * Automated Backups take a daily full snapshot and will store transaction logs throughtout the day.
        * When you do a recovery, AWS will choose the most recent daily snapshot and apply those transaction logs relevant to that day.
        * This allows to do a point-in-time recovery down to a second,within the retention period.

        * Automated Backups are enabled by default.
        * Backups are stored in S3.
        * Free storage equal to the size of the database.
        * During backup, some elevated latency may be experienced.


    Snapshots:
    ==========

        * DB snapshots are done manually.
        * They are stored even after you delete the original RDS instance.

        Restore:
        --------
        * When we Restore an Automated Backups or DB snapshot, the restored version of the database in a new RDS instance. with a new DNS endpoint.


    Encryption:
    ===========
    
    * Encryption is done using KMS
    * Once the DB is encrypted the data stored at rest is automatically encrypted.
    * Encrypting an existing DB is not supported.
    * To use an RDS encryption for an existing database, create a snapshot and copy it and encrypt it.


    Multi AZ:
    =========
    
    * Synchronously replicated to another AZ.
    * For DR only.
    * Allows you to have an exact of the production database in another AZ.
    * AWS handles the replication for you.
    * Production database is written to, that write will be automatically synchronized to the DR DB.
    * Multi-AZ is for DR only.
    * Not used to improve performance.
    * For that,use Read Replicas.


    Read Replicas:
    ===============

    * 5 Read Replicas for production database.
    * Read Replicas of Read Replicas
    * Read only copy of your production database.
    * Async replication from the primary RDS instance to the read replica.
    * Use read replicas for very read-heavy database workloads.
    * Use for scaling.
    * Must have automatic backups turned on to deploy a read replica.
    * 5 read replicas of any database.
    * Each read replica will have its own DNS endpoint.
    * Read replicas with multi-AZ possible.
    * You can create read replicas of Multi-AZ databases.
    * Read replicas can be promoted to their own databases.
    * Read replica in another region is also possible.
