ElasticCache:
==============

    * In-memory storage in the cloud.
    * Master/Slave replication and Multi-AZ which can used to achieve cross AZ redudancy.

Engines:
========

    Memcached - Memory object caching system.
    Redis - in memory Key-value storage

    * Significantly improve latency and throughput for many read-heavy application workloads.
    * Caching improves applications performance by storing critical pieces of data in-memory for low latency access.
    * 

    Stress Test:
    ===========

    * ElasticCache is a good choice if database is read heavy and not prone to frequent changing.
    * Redshift is a good answer if the reason your database if feeling stress if because the management keep running OLAP transactions on it etc.
